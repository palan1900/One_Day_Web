				The experience of helping other women
			</h2>
			<p>
				
I think economic empowerment occurs when someone is able to see and know of opportunities (understand/know where they can go or who they can speak to) to develop an idea or follow a path to their goal and then is able to gather the resources to do so. In a society in which men and women have equal economic empowerment, women would be presented with the same opportunities as men, have the same resources, skills, knowledge and and support to take advantage of them and the result, in terms of salary, reward, recognition etc. be the same as those offered to men. Also, the rhetoric around women in gender-based non-stereotypical roles would be minimal to none, having recognized the benefit that the diversity brings to the table.

				#Herstory: Savitribai Phule, a beacon of hope for women in the 19th century By Sangeeta Gadepalli on 04 December 2016 
			</h2>
			<p>
				“Go, Get Education
				Be self-reliant, be industrious
				Work, gather wisdom and riches,
				All gets lost without knowledge
				We become animal without wisdom,
				Sit idle no more, go, get education
				End misery of the oppressed and forsaken,
				You’ve got a golden chance to learn
				So learn and break the chains of caste.
				Throw away the Brahman’s scriptures fast."
				    - Savitribai Phule

				Rasomati's Story
			</h2>
			<p>
				Rasomati Sarkar lives in Tehsil-Kishanganj in the Baran District of Rajasthan. She learned about computers through the 2E2 Programme and now she is teaching her new-found skills to the other women in her community.
However, she is not just a trainer, she is also a campaigner; promoting the importance of computer education and digitalization. She also helps members of her community to fill out forms to apply for their old-age pension, to apply for their Adhaar number (necessary for the Indian biometric ID system), to carry out net banking, make ticket bookings and make ‘Right to information’ applications. She also gives information to community members about Government schemes.

				Weaving Tales and Breaking Stereotypes By Sharda Vishwanathan on 04 May 2017
			</h2>
			<p>
				As an Empower Women Champion for Change, I took a close look at children’s literature. I found that it is not uncommon to find stories where caregiving and home care is associated with women while men are the breadwinners who participate in all kinds of economic activities. Fairytales have contributed to reinforcing gender stereotypes; illustrating princesses as "damsel in distress" who needs a man to save her.

				My Journey from self-empowerment to empowerment to others- by  Manisha Kad
			</h2>
			<p>
				
In May 2013, I left my job with my organization after 15+ years of working without break. I left my job because it was difficult to achieve work-personal life balance. The plan decided was to start a small company providing Embedded System Technology Services named as SAADH Embedded System Solutions. This risky step was taken to achieve work-life balance, flexibility, learning new things related to business and face new challenges. While working with organization I already had experience in project management and team handling. Initial thought was to try for business for 6 months to see how it goes. However, Things went smoothly and dropped the plan of job.

				A bank for women, by women
By Sharda Vishwanathan interviews Ms. Chetna Sinha on 26 November 2016 
India
			</h2>
			<p>
				
“Let me take you back in time, to 1995, the year when it all started. Kantabai, a blacksmith from a village called Mhaswad in the state of Maharashtra in India, walked up to me and told me that she wanted to save money and no bank in the village was ready to help her open an account. I wondered why, not until the next day, when I accompanied her and heard the same thing from all the banks. And what could be the possible reason for this? With the deposit amount being less than a dollar i.e. Rs.5-10/-(7-15 cents), it was too small a deposit for a bank to be able to maintain her account,” recollects Chetna Sinha, Founder of Mann Deshi Mahila Sahakari Bank, India’s first rural cooperative bank for women, by women. </p>
