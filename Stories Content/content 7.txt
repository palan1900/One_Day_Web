Empowering Rural Women in India:Meet Uthara Narayanan
By Sonia Aoula

The 10th of October 2016,I had the chance to meet Uthara Narayanan, through my project The EntreprenHer Tour.
 
Uthara created BuzzIndia in 2012. She studied accountancy but never worked as an accountant. She wanted to work in social development since she always found important to make a difference. Uthara was selected as an Acumen Fellow in 2015.

BuzzIndia provides leadership and entrepreneurship skills to poor women from rural areas. 4 subjects are being taught: Financial skills- Business skills- Personnal 
Development skills and Goal settings. Uthara underlined the fact that her project focuses on the WHY. BuzzIndia aims at making people problem solvers and it gives women the knowledge and the tools to give them the choice to manage their life as they intend to.

BuzzIndia receives grants from different organizations like Citi Foundation. Until now, 10 000 women had the training in villages near Bangalore. Uthara wants to reach 1 million women in the state of Karnataka by 2025.

Breaking the ceiling to rural women in India, this is Uthara's goal! As she said to us: the contrary of poverty is not wealth but dignity.
By giving back the dignity to rural women in India, BuzzIndia leads to their empowerment!
