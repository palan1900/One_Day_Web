The experience of helping other women



I think economic empowerment occurs when someone is able to see and know of opportunities (understand/know where they can go or who they can speak to) to develop an idea or follow a path to their goal and then is able to gather the resources to do so. In a society in which men and women have equal economic empowerment, women would be presented with the same opportunities as men, have the same resources, skills, knowledge and and support to take advantage of them and the result, in terms of salary, reward, recognition etc. be the same as those offered to men. Also, the rhetoric around women in gender-based non-stereotypical roles would be minimal to none, having recognized the benefit that the diversity brings to the table. 

I, myself, work in a male dominated industry of technology as a consultant and the ration of women to men is often very low, including in positions of leadership. To promote interest and, even the confidence, in women to join technology related careers, I often mentor women and ask them questions that hopefully make them think about all the options available to them and to encourage them to try things that they would not have considered for themselves. I also volunteer-taught courses in web programming to women. It was admirable to see these women from diverse backgrounds, take the step to learn something that they have no idea about and to use that to try to achieve their own goals of being a food blogger, an entrepreneur etc. I think this was one of the most vivid examples of women's economic empowerment for me - I was able to use my knowledge in a field in which there are mostly men to help women who had read, found out about these courses, put in the time and commitment to attend these and then who went on to progress in careers that they had wanted for themselves.
