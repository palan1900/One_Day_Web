	Children begin to form gender stereotypes about occupations from the age of six*.Having the opportunity at primary school to meet a wide range of women doing different jobs is really important.
	Inspiring Women connects schools with inspirational, diverse female volunteers from a range of interesting careers, who come into school to talk to young people about their jobs and show how what 
	they are learning at school  can lead to an interesting, exciting futures. Our in-school activities feed children’s curiosity, break down gender stereotypes and opens their eyes to future possibilities.
	We challenge girls to think about what they want to be and why and show them that they can achieve anything they set their minds to.

	The <b>Inspiring Women campaign</b> already has over 24,500 amazing women ready to talk with girls in state schools about the ‘job they do’ and route they took. Our campaign has women from a wide range of 
	occupations going into schools, who will collectively be talking to over 500,000 young women.

	Our volunteers may be asked by teachers to take part in ‘career speed networking’ events, informal classroom talks, enterprise activities or careers fairs with students.
